## Notes

This South African milk tart (melktert) features a sweet, cookie-like crust that may puff during baking - simply press it back into shape while still warm. For best results, use full-fat milk for the richest custard. The custard should be poured while still warm to ensure smooth texture. Chill thoroughly before serving for proper set. Some bakers recommend greasing the pie pans well to prevent sticking, and piercing the crust with a fork before baking can help prevent excessive puffing.
