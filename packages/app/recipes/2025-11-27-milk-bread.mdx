## Notes

1. If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle

2. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger-if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a windowpane test to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golf ball size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it's thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.

3. To test for doneness, if you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an instant-read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 195-200°F (90-93°C).
