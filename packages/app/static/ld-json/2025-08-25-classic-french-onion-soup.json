I substituted the balsamic for the wine. It turned out wonderful! The cheesy garlic bread is perfect in this as well. I added extra mozzarella on the top of the bread in the cup of soup (oven proof cup) and placed it beneath the broiler). Very very good!",

          "reviewBody": "If you're following the recipe pretty closely, the biggest contributors to saltiness would most likely be the beef stock/broth and the bouillon. Bouillon is often very salty, but a lot of store-bought/premade broths are pretty salty as well, so maybe look for a reduced sodium version!\r\n\r\nThis is such a simple soup, with so few ingredients, I feel like it's a perfect recipe for a home-made soup stock to really shine! I like to save the carcasses of (usually grocery store rotisserie) chickens, and any \"waste\" ends of onions, carrots, and celery in the freezer until I've got a hankering to make soup, then stick it all in a big stock pot, add water until everything is covered, and let it simmer all day. The gelatin from the connective tissue in the chicken carcasses makes for a lovely mouth feel an heartiness in a soup, and you just can't beat that depth of flavour!",
