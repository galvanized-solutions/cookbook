## Notes

This traditional Dominican dessert is perfect for hot summer days. The sweetened corn mixture can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. For best results, use fresh corn when in season, though frozen corn kernels work as a substitute. Serve immediately after assembling to prevent the ice from melting.
